# Heuristic

In computer science, a heuristic is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fails to 
find any exact solution. This is acheived by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. 

The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. This solution may not be the best of all solutions to this problem
, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time.
